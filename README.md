# Fifa-2019-Data-Visualisation
In this project, I analysed the data from the Fifa 2019 dataset taken from Kaggle. 

To run the project download all the files in one folder and run the file 'main.md'. Then choose the option "Toggle markdown preview enhanced with litvis" (^+cmd+M for MAC). This way you will be able to see all analysis. OTHERWISE NOT ALL GRAPHS WILL BE DISPLAYED!

The file 'board.jpg' is a visualisation board, where the main insights can be seen.
